# License and contributions

The software is provided under the Apache-2.0 license. All contributions to software and documents are licensed by contributors under the same license model as the software/document itself (ie. inbound == outbound licensing). Open IoT SDK may reuse software already licensed under another license, provided the license is permissive in nature and compatible with Apache v2.0.

Folders containing files under different permissive license than Apache 2.0 are listed in the LICENSE file.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## Security issues reporting

If you find any security vulnerabilities, please do not report it in the GitLab issue tracker. Instead, send an email to the security team at arm-security@arm.com stating that you may have found a security vulnerability in the Open IoT SDK toolchain project.

More details can be found at [Arm Developer website](https://developer.arm.com/support/arm-security-updates/report-security-vulnerabilities).
